<p>Welcome to Brutus theme's. An agile, powerful, easy and accessible theme for theme developers.</p>

<p>The main reason for the Brutus theme development is to make the work easier for themer developers.</p>

<p>After many years using Zen, 960 and Fusion themes, tuning and customizing them I have developed a new theme that provides an agile, powerful, easy and accessible theme development.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

- Download Brutus from http://drupal.org/project/brutus
- Unpack the downloaded file and place the Brutus folder in your Drupal installation under 
  one of the following locations:

    * sites/all/themes
    * sites/default/themes
    * sites/example.com/themes

  Administer > Site building > Themes (admin/build/themes) and make Basic the default theme.

follow these steps (to do BEFORE enabling the theme) :

Changing the Layout

The layout used in Brutus is fairly similar to the Holy Grail method. It has been tested on all major browser including IE (5>8), Opera, Firefox, Safari, Chrome ...
The purpose of this method is to have a minimal markup for an ideal display. 
For accessibility and search engine optimization, the best order to display a page is the following :

	1. header
	2. menu
	2. content
	3. sidebars
	4. footer
